# QuantumGrades — Website

This repository contains the official website for the QuantumGradesApp project.

Current scope:
- static HTML/CSS
- English-only
- project overview and status

Future plans (post QGA v2.0):
- multilingual content (EN/DE/PL)
- documentation
- product dashboard (separate service)

The website is intentionally minimal to keep the focus on the core product.

## Language policy

English is the source language.
German and Polish versions are planned after the core product stabilizes.
